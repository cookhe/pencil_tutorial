## Setting up your rusty environment for Pencil

Pencil is written in Fortran90/2003, with some auxiliary C-code. You'll need both a Fortran and a C compiler. Load both with 

	module load openmpi
        
Next git clone the pencil code on your home directory

	git clone https://github.com/pencil-code/pencil-code.git
